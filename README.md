# downscalr
A package for high-resolution simulation of land-use change projections, with support for downscaling. Based on IIASA's [DownScale](https://github.com/iiasa/DownScale) package, which was developed to provide high-resolution projections of the [GLOBIOM](https://iiasa.ac.at/web/home/research/GLOBIOM/GLOBIOM.html) model.

# Installation:

You need R to run the scripts. In R the following commands install the devtools and downscalr packages. Devtools is required to install packages from Github.

      # install.packages("devtools")
      devtools::install_github("tkrisztin/downscalr",ref="HEAD")
      
# Running downscalr

First a prior model needs to be run. This can be done using the mnlogit() function. For further help type in the R-console:

      help(downscalr)
